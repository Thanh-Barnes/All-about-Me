          Utilizing over 20 years of global business and education sector experience, since 2012 I have been developing and supporting individuals and businesses through coaching.  I encourage people to raise their standards by encouraging them to think and act bigger.  Over the past eight years, I’ve coached professionals in Education, Business, Marketing and Politics, as well as start up organisations, small business owners and students.
